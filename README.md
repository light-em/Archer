## ARCHER
*by PrinceDevel aka light.em*
<hr>

#### How To Use ?
- use __JetBrainsMono Nerd Font__ for best experience
- MONO Fonts are Needed for my Themes to look good.
- The dot files are in /setup/home
- You can do it manually (recommended to learn)
- Alternatively, You can use my script   __*WITH CAUTION READ BOTTOM LINES CAREFULLY*__
<hr>

#### SCRIPT USAGE: *ONLY FOR ARCH SYSTEM*
1. Make Sure u have package (rsync) installed :] it is needed
2. U need to CLONE project in $HOME directory
3. Don't  Run  scripts/RsyncSetup.sh  It might replace setup/ with yours
    - Unless you want to use my script to distribute your own dots :]

4. #### Using scripts/RsyncSystem.sh 
    - __Feature:__  It will only copy dots whose dependencies are installed in your system 
    - Running it will replace your old dots with my new ones ...
    ```bash
    sh $HOME/Archer/scripts/RsyncSystem.sh
    ```
    - To Preserve Your Old Configs as backup
    ```bash
    sh $HOME/Archer/scripts/RsyncSystem.sh --backup
    ```
